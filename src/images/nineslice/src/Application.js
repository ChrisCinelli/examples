//# 9-Slice Image Scaling <a title="View raw file" href="https://raw.github.com/gameclosure/addon-examples/master/src/images/nineslice/src/Application.js"><img src="../../include/download_icon.png" class="icon"></a>
//Given the following image:
//<img src="./doc/button.png" alt="button image" class="screenshot" style="display:block;width:200px;">

//We can scale it to the dimensions of the device (with a slight centering for visibility) so
//that the rounded corners maintain their integrity while the middle section is scaled out.
//This way buttons can maintain their style despite the dimensions of the device.

//Here, the image is sliced and scaled out, and a label is given to the button by assigning a
//`TextView` as a child. The child viewâ€™s dimensions is set to the width and height of the middle
//section of the `ImageScaleView`, and set to a very light blue so you can see it in the example
//below. The debugging flag of the `ImageScaleView` is set to true so you can see how the slices
//are sectioned off.

import device;
import ui.ImageScaleView;
